SuSE AGENT USAGE README
The Suse agent can be used to deploy and install application on remote systems
in Cloud environment, which is Cloudify-compatible. This version of agent
is tested and stable on Cloudify version 3.1. This readme and tutorial
covers deployment of Nodecellar application (Cloudify example app) on Openstack based cloud.


1. Required components:
- agent package
  'SuSE-11-final-3.1-agent.tar.gz'
- configuration files:
  'SuSE-agent-disable-requiretty.sh'
  'SuSE-celeryd-cloudify.conf'
  'SuSE-celeryd-cloudify.init'

2. System requirements:
- SLES 11 SP 3 operating system image with python 2.6.9 preinstalled
- minimum of 2GB of RAM (recommended 4GB)

3. Prerequisites
- Cloudify Manager 3.1
- Cloudify Client (CLI) 3.1 already connected to Cloudify Manager
  (this can be veryfied using 'cfy --version')
- git toolset installed on the Cloudify Client machine
- an access to the Openstack based cloud environment.

The best way to learn the usage of the SuSE agent package is to follow step by step
tutorial. Basic Cloudify tutorial include Nodecellar application, which is more than
suitable to show the capabilities of agent on new system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The SuSE agent package can be used on any Cloudify-compatible environment.
      The Openstack system is used here only for an example purposes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's start with downloading Nodecellar app release version 3.1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: You can follow the official Gigaspaces Cloudify documentation
      for downloading of Nodecellar app
- http://getcloudify.org/guide/3.1/quickstart.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Summary of what needs to be done:
- git clone https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example
- git checkout tags/3.1


Once checkout is complete, some minor modifications need to be done to the blueprint
('openstack-blueprint.yaml'), as well as inputs.json files in order to utilize the SuSE agent.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: For detailed Openstack deployment process:
- http://getcloudify.org/guide/3.1/quickstart-openstack.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the inputs.json file, change the values accordingly to Your preferences:
- image: the id of the system on which the agent will be deployed
  (taken from Your Cloud - in our case it should be SLES 11 SP3)
- flavor: the size of the virtual machine that will be created for the agent machine
  (once again - taken from Your Cloud provider)
- agent_user: the user which will be configured on the agent machine

In the blueprint file, further modifications are as follows:
under nodecellar.nodes.MonitoredServer, which represents the agent machine type node, modify the
properties/cloudify_agent/default subentry. Add entries:
- 'agent_package_path: relative/path/from/blueprint/SuSE-11-final-3.1-agent.tar.gz'
- 'celery_config_path: blueprints/{BPID}/relative/path/from/blueprint/SuSE-celeryd-cloudify.conf'
- 'celery_init_path: blueprints/{BPID}/relative/path/from/blueprint/SuSE-celeryd-cloudify.init'
- 'disable_requiretty_script_path: relative/path/from/blueprint/SuSE-agent-disable-requiretty.sh'

Elaborating:
- 'relative/path/from/blueprint/' is a relative path taken from the location
of the blueprint file beeing modyfied (and is about to be uploaded), to the SuSE agent/configuration file.
- {BPID} part needs to be replaced with the identification name of the blueprint, under which it will
be uploaded to the Cloudify Manager machine.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The example lines taken from an actual configuration file:
  nodecellar.nodes.MonitoredServer:
    derived_from: cloudify.openstack.nodes.Server
    properties:
      cloudify_agent:
        default:
          user: vagrant
          agent_package_path: SuSE-11-final-3.1-agent.tar.gz
          celery_config_path: blueprints/bp/SuSE-celeryd-cloudify.conf
          celery_init_path:  blueprints/bp/SuSE-celeryd-cloudify.init
          disable_requiretty_script_path: SuSE-agent-disable-requiretty.sh

In the above example, all files are present in the very same directory as the blueprint file.
Also, the blueprint was subsequently uploaded onto the Manager machine with the id 'bp'.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The next steps are to:
- upload the blueprint onto the Manager:
  cfy blueprints upload -b {BPID} -p {path/to/the/blueprint/blueprint_name}
- create the deployment
  cfy deployments create -b {BPID} -d {DPID}
- execute the installation process
  cfy executions start -d {DPID} -w install

Where {BPID}, {DPID} are blueprint and deployment identification names of Your choosing, respectively.
And once more, the process is described in greater detail Cloudify documentation pages (links in NOTE areas).
